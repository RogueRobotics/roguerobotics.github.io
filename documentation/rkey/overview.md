The rKey Capacitive Touch Key Module is an easy way to add user input to your project.

  * Auto-calibration
    * The rKey auto-calibrates on power-up to maximize effectiveness through whatever panel material and thickness is used (up to 0.4"/10mm).
  * Durable
    * Because there are no moving parts, and the rKey can be mounted behind a sealed panel, possibility of physical damage is at a minimum.
  * Low Power
    * Using break-through technology, the rKey uses extremely little power to detect touches.  At 5.0V, less than 80 Î¼A are needed.
  * Separate LED control
    * To have complex visual feedback, the LED on-board the rKey can be controlled separately by a microcontroller.  For simple touch feedback, the rKey output can be connected to the LED input.
