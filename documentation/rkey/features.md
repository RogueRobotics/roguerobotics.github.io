  * Auto-calibration on power-up for panel/overlay thickness
  * Ultra low power operation - 80 μA @ 5.0V
    * Power can be controlled by microcontroller logic pin (for forced recalibration, if needed)
  * Separate LED from detection circuit - for complex feedback
    * LED can be connected to output, for simple feedback
