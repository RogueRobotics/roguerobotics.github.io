## Absolute Maximum Ratings

|**Operating Temperature**      |  -55째C to +125째C  |
|**Storage Temperature**        |  -65째C to +150째C  |
|**Voltage on any pin**         |  -0.5V to Vcc+0.5V  |
|**Maximum Operating Voltage**  |  6.0V  |

***WARNING:*** Exceeding values beyond these **absolute maximum** values may cause permanent damage to the device and/or card!  Operating at **absolute maximum** rating conditions for extended periods may affect device and/or card reliability.

[^a]: Because card active and idle current values vary widely from brand to brand, a maximum cannot be determined.  Please refer to your card manufacturers specifications for read/write current consumption values.
[^b]: This is the maximum current that the on-board LDO regulator will supply.  Cards that require more power than this are not supported.
[^c]: "Max" means the highest value where the pin is guaranteed to be read as low.
[^d]: "Min" means the lowest value where the pin is guaranteed to be read as high.
