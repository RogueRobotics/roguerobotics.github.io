# Installation Instructions

Follow the [instructions](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) from the Arduino(tm) site to install the latest Arduino(tm) software.

## rEDI/rDuino Core Installation

### Arduino IDE version 0018+

Unzip the core to the "hardware" folder of your sketchbook folder.

e.g. Your sketchbook folder is: `C:\Arduino\sketchbook`

  * make a folder named "`hardware`" in the `sketchbook` folder, if it doesn't already exist:
    * `C:\Arduino\sketchbook\hardware`
  * unzip the rDuino core into the `hardware` folder, resulting in:
    * `C:\Arduino\sketchbook\hardware\`**`rDuino`**
