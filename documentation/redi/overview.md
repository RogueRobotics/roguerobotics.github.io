The rEDI Educational Board is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega644P. It has 32 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 8 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, 4 PWM controlled servo headers, 4 switch/led combos, a piezo speaker, a 10 kOhm thumb wheel trim-pot, a breadboard, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.
