Here you'll find libraries for different platforms.

We're looking for as many platforms as possible.  So if you write a library for a platform (that doesn't already exist here), we'll give you a uMMC/uMP3/rMP3!  [Contact us](//www.roguerobotics.com/pages/contact-us?form_type=contact&contact[category]=General&contact[body]={{"RE: Libraries%0d%0d" | escape_once}}), and ask us for more details!

## Libraries for Arduino

Really simple libraries for communicating with the Rogue Robotics SD Card and Playback Modules (uMMC, uMP3, rMP3).

  * [RogueSD]({{ base_path }}/code/library/arduino/roguesd): A library for file functions on the Rogue SD card products (uMMC/uMP3/rMP3)
  * [RogueMP3]({{ base_path }}/code/library/arduino/roguemp3): A library for MP3 playback functions on the Rogue playback products (uMP3/rMP3)
  * Download from: [Libraries for Arduino](http://code.google.com/p/rogue-code/)
